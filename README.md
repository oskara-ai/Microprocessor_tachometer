# Microprocessor_tachometer
 Prototype of an analog tachometer
 
The prototype was made using Arduino Uno to control the connection. As a stepper motor
model ADAFRUIT ADA2424 Automotive Gauge Stepper Motor was used and motor control needed
also the H-bridge circuit L293D, the outputs of which were connected to the motor. The operating voltage of the logic is + 5V and
the motor uses + 9V voltage.

Picture shows a circuit diagram of the connection, from which we can see how the outputs from Arduino to the H-bridge and
the outputs to the motor go from the H-bridge.
